# Sales & Revenue Analysis Dashboard 
This Dashboard aims to provide insights for a Software company on the Sales opportunities and revenue generation. This Dasboard provides an executive level information on where most of the sales opportunities are coming from as well as which area is generating more revenue, including states, Product and Zones as well.
# Dashboard Design and Creation.
In this analysis I focussed on digging deeper into analysing Sales opportunities and revenue generation through the integration of Key tables: account, Fact/Revenue, SalesStage and Product. Utilizing all these tables, I examined Sales pipeline, pinpointed important conversion points, Created Filter by Product code to generate analysis on each product. 

The first Step in this project was to clean the data to ensure accurate analysis. I made sure I removed any duplicates or missing data to avoid discrepencies in the results. I assigned correct data type to the ones that had incorrect one. 
Once the data was ready, I generated custom metrics to look at the data in a different way. For example, Revenue Per Customer or RPC which tells us how much revenue we are generaing per customer. 
Ultimately, the analysis showcases the efficacy of Power BI in unraveling complex sales dynamics and driving informed decision-makg for enhanced business growth.
